#by including the Speed module in the Car class, the instance method go_fast is now availble to all Car objects. Here the go_fast method is being called by a car object, where self inside an instance method refers to the calling object. When chained with the class method it will refer to the calling objects class, which in this case is Car

# We use self.class in the method and this works the following way:
#
# self refers to the object itself, in this case either a Car or Truck object.
# We ask self to tell us its class with .class. It tells us.
# We don't need to use to_s here because it is inside of a string and is interpolated which means it will take care of the to_s for us.

# self.cats count is a class method within the Cat class. In this case self here means the class itself which would be Cat
